# Day Three

## Part One

I feel like there's a "good" way to do this...

But I'm just going to read all the stuff into a character map, and then go through and find what numbers have symbols next to them...

That works.

## Part Two

My solution to part one doesn't really work with part two... However, if I just go through and parse my input to a list of numbers associated with symbols, then that should work for bother part one and two.

I ended up not needing to really change much of my part 1 solution to make it work for part 2 as well. I just added a map of for symbols and kept my numbers there.
